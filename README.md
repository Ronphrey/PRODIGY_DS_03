# Purchase Predictor

This project involves analyzing and predicting purchasing behavior using a structured dataset. The notebook demonstrates data exploration, preprocessing, and predictive modeling techniques to understand and forecast customer purchase decisions.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- **Modeling**: Build and evaluate predictive models to forecast purchase decisions.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to understand key trends and model performance.

## Requirements

The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Ensure you have these libraries installed before running the notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Purchase_Predictor.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the notebook's cells step-by-step to explore the data and build the predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes [insert details about the dataset, e.g., number of rows, columns, and features]. Ensure the dataset is placed in the project directory.

## Results

The project evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy or others (depending on implementation). For detailed results, refer to the notebook.
