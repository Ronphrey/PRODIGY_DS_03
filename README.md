# Purchase Predictor

This project involves analyzing and predicting purchasing behavior using a structured dataset. The notebook demonstrates data exploration, preprocessing, and predictive modeling techniques to understand and forecast customer purchase decisions.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- **Modeling**: Build and evaluate predictive models to forecast purchase decisions.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to understand key trends and model performance.

## Requirements

The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Ensure you have these libraries installed before running the notebook.
